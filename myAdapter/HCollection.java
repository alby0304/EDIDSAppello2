/**
 * The root interface in the <i>collection hierarchy</i>. A collection
 * represents a group of objects, known as its <i>elements</i>. Some collections
 * allow duplicate elements and others do not. Some are ordered and others
 * unordered. The SDK does not provide any <i>direct</i> implementations of this
 * interface: it provides implementations of more specific subinterfaces like
 * <code>Set</code> and <code>List</code>. This interface is typically used to
 * pass collections around and manipulate them where maximum generality is
 * desired.
 *
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <i>Bags</i> or <i>multisets</i> (unordered collections that may contain
 * duplicate elements) should implement this interface directly.
 *
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * All general-purpose <code>Collection</code> implementation classes (which
 * typically implement <code>Collection</code> indirectly through one of its
 * subinterfaces) should provide two "standard" constructors: a void (no
 * arguments) constructor, which creates an empty collection, and a constructor
 * with a single argument of type <code>Collection</code>, which creates a new
 * collection with the same elements as its argument. In effect, the latter
 * constructor allows the user to copy any collection, producing an equivalent
 * collection of the desired implementation type. There is no way to enforce
 * this convention (as interfaces cannot contain constructors) but all of the
 * general-purpose <code>Collection</code> implementations in the Java platform
 * libraries comply.
 *
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the methods
 * that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified to throw
 * <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> if this collection does not
 * support the operation. If this is the case, these methods may, but are not
 * required to, throw an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> if the
 * invocation would have no effect on the collection. For example, invoking the
 * {@link #addAll(HCollection)} method on an unmodifiable collection may, but is
 * not required to, throw the exception if the collection to be added is empty.
 *
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Some collection implementations have restrictions on the elements that they
 * may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null elements, and
 * some have restrictions on the types of their elements. Attempting to add an
 * ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * <code>NullPointerException</code> or <code>ClassCastException</code>.
 * Attempting to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an
 * exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit
 * the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally,
 * attempting an operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not
 * result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the collection may
 * throw an exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
